# Awesome Aya [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of awesome eBPF 🐝 projects using aya-rs and Rust 🦀

eBPF is a technology that allows running user-supplied programs inside the Linux kernel.
For more info see https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf.

[Aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya) is an eBPF library built with a focus on operability
and developer experience. It does not rely on libbpf nor bcc - it's built from the ground
up purely in Rust, using only the libc crate to execute syscalls. With BTF support and
when linked with musl, it offers a true compile once, run everywhere solution, where
a single self-contained binary can be deployed on many linux distributions and kernel
versions.

Some of the major features provided include:

- Support for the **BPF Type Format** (BTF), which is transparently enabled when supported by
  the target kernel. This allows eBPF programs compiled against one kernel version to run
  on different kernel versions without the need to recompile.
- Support for function call relocation and global data maps, which allows eBPF programs to
  make **function calls** and use **global variables and initializers**.
- **Async support** with both tokio and async-std.
- Easy to deploy and fast to build: aya doesn't require a kernel build or compiled
  headers, and not even a C toolchain; a release build completes in a matter of seconds.

> Note: The eBPF ecosystem in general is constantly evolving, including Aya itself. We'd
> love your help to keep this list up to date. Please feel free to file an issue or make
> a PR if you would like to make a correction or want to have your awesome project included.

## Articles and Presentations

### Aya-related blog posts

- [The original announcement of the Aya project](https://confused.ai/posts/announcing-aya)
    - Covers the goals of the project and some early logistics
- [Adding BPF target support to the Rust compiler](https://confused.ai/posts/rust-bpf-target)

### Aya-related talks

- [eCHO episode 25: eBPF, Rust, and Aya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ0ou-eFLAk)
    - Dave Tucker and Alessandro Decina discuss the Aya project and writing eBPF programs in Rust

## Small Tools that Use Aya

- [suidsnoop](https://github.com/willfindlay/suidsnoop) - Uses Aya and eBPF LSM programs to implement audit logging and policy enforcement for suid binaries
    - Includes examples of:
        - Writing LSM programs in aya-bpf
        - Getting LSM program arguments in aya-bpf
        - Enforcing custom security policy in aya-bpf
        - Using `aya::AsyncPerfEventArray` to pass events to userspace

## Major Projects that Use Aya

- [lockc](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/lockc) - An eBPF LSM-based MAC security audit system for container workloads in the cloud
    - A future version of lockc will [migrate to use Aya](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/lockc/issues/49) for both userspace and eBPF
    - This entry will be updated when the changes have been merged

## Aya eBPF-Side Libraries

- [aya-log](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya-log) - A logging library for eBPF programs written using aya-bpf
    - This is a fully-reusable logging library for eBPF programs written in aya
    - It provides a logging interface for eBPF programs that emulates Rust's standard log crate
